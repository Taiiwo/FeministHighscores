FeministBlocker
===============
Description
-----------
This is a project inspired by GGAutoBlocker that aims to identify radical
feminists and anti-gamergate supporters, and instead of maliciously and
oppressively adding them to an ambiguous blocklist conflictingly making
them more likely to attempt the behaviour and opinions they are being
punished for, this script attempts to allow it's users to identify and
aggregate these radicals for the purpose of mass ridicule and
the collection of such humorously idiotic thoughts.
