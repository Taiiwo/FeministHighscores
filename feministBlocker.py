# This is a project inspired by GGAutoBlocker that aims to identify radical
# feminists and anti-gamergate supporters, and instead of maliciously and
# oppressively adding them to an ambiguous blocklist conflictingly making
# them more likely to attempt the behaviour and opinions they are being
# punished for, this script attempts to allow it's users to identify and
# aggregate these radicals for the purpose of mass ridicule and
# identification of such humorously idiotic thoughts.
